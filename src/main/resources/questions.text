Question No 1:
Problem: Move Zeros to the end

Description:
Given an integer array, move all 0s to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

Example:
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]



Question No 2:
Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Description:
Given a sorted array of integers nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once. Return the new length of the array after removing duplicates.
You must do this without using extra space for another array â€” modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
The order of elements should be maintained. You do not need to consider elements beyond the returned length.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]   // _ means any value beyond new length
Explanation: The first two elements after removing duplicates are 1 and 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
